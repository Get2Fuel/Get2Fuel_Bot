This is a service for a Telegram Bot that consumes [Osservaprezzi-Carburanti](https://carburanti.mise.gov.it/OssPrezziSearch/) APIs through [OsservaPrezzi-Connector](https://github.com/Get2Fuel/OsservaPrezzi-Connector)

At the moment this bot just sends you the pumps around you, sorted by price based on your location.
